# Alexander Thompson B.S.c (Hons)

**Data Scientist and Economist**

*BSc (Hons) Economics*

## About
My name is Alexander, and I am a recent graduate with a BSc in Economics. I have a strong passion for continuous learning and enjoy exploring how new knowledge can be applied in practical, meaningful ways. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I independently taught myself Forex and commodities trading, which introduced me to the dynamic nature of financial markets. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for problem-solving and skill development, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Economics.

Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in economic theory, econometrics, and statistical analysis. I gained proficiency in various statistical software packages, and I completed the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate, which enhanced my understanding of financial markets and allowed me to confidently navigate the Bloomberg Terminal.

Following graduation, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I acquired key skills in data analysis, including SQL and R. My final project involved a comprehensive case study, applying these tools to derive actionable insights. I initially learned SQL using the BigQuery dialect and later expanded my knowledge to include SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). I also integrated RStudio with my database and continued to build on my R skills through participation in a Kaggle competition, where I used the XGBoost model to predict insurance premiums. Additionally, I’ve learned how to access, analyze, and visualize data from sources such as Eurostat and FRED using R.

I recently completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate, where I developed strong proficiency for Python for data science, including exploratory data analysis, statistics, regression analysis and machine learnig.

The statistical training covered both descriptive and inferential statistics applied in Python, thereby building on a solid foundation from my university degree. In regression analysis, I combined the certificate's practical Python focus with extensive academic experience having implemented regression models by hand and across tools such as Excel, IBM SPSS, MiniTab and EViews alongside rigorous testing of OLS assumptions using econometric methods. The machine learning component of the certificate included supervised models such as Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost and unsupervised techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering. The topics included featrure engineering, hyperparemeter tuning, bias-variance tradeoff and cross-validation as well as so much more. I have demonstrated these methods through applied case studies in my portfolio, which you're welcome to explore.

Currently I am expanding my portfolio with additional end-to-end projects and case studies, while progressing into deep learning and neural networks.
